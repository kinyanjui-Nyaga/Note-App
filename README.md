### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- Ensure you have Android Studio installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website.

- Make sure you have Git installed to clone the repository.

### Setup

-Open a terminal or command prompt.

### Run tests

To run tests, do the following command:

- Write unit tests and UI tests to ensure the app’s functionality works as 
   expected.

- Use tools like JUnit and Espresso for testing.

- Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. Here’s how to write and run unit tests for your app:

Create a Test Class:
   - In your project, create a new directory (usually named test) under the src folder.
   - Inside this directory, create a Kotlin class for your unit tests. For example, CoffeeShopViewModelTest.
     
Write Test Methods:
   - Define test methods within your test class.
   - Use JUnit annotations (@Test, @Before, @After, etc.) to set up and execute tests.
   - Test various scenarios, such as ViewModel logic, data transformations, or utility functions.
     
Mock Dependencies:
   - Use mock objects or dependency injection to isolate the component you’re testing.
   - For example, if you’re testing a ViewModel, mock the repository or data source.
     
Run Tests:
   - Right-click on your test class and select “Run” to execute the tests.
   - Observe the test results in the Android Studio console.
     

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using:
  - Deploy your app to an emulator or a physical device for testing.
